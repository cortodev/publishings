Here you'll find some web publishings I made using my own template.

All of them are based on [HTML5](http://w3schools.com/html5/default.asp), [CCS3](http://w3schools.com/css3/default.asp) for the presentation, [Raphael](www.raphaeljs.com) for drawing [SVG](http://w3schools.com/svg/default.asp) and [jQuery](www.jquery.com) to manage Javascript.

I try to use as less Javascript as possible (except for generating SVG). I aim to create full CSS publishing.
